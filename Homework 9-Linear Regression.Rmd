## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading data}

# load data

life_expectancy <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-12-05/life_expectancy.csv')

```

```{r regression}

# Linear regression years before 1883 (Koch's germ theory)

lm_b1883 <- lm(LifeExpectancy ~ Year, data = life_expectancy[life_expectancy$Year < 1883,])

summary(lm_b1883)




# Linear regression years after 1883 (Koch's germ theory)

lm_a1883 <- lm(LifeExpectancy ~ Year, data = life_expectancy[life_expectancy$Year > 1883,])

summary(lm_a1883)

```

```{r scatterplot}

plot(life_expectancy$Year,life_expectancy$LifeExpectancy, pch = 19, col = "grey", xlab = "Year of Birth", ylab = "Life Expectancy")

abline(lm_b1883, lt = 3)

abline(lm_a1883, lt = 1)

```
