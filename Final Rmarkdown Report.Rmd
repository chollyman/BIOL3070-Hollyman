# ABSTRACT

This report analyzes data on the percentage of days with poor air quality and the percentage of adults with current asthma grouped by US state. Statistical analysis revealed a weak, slight negative correlation between the variables, with states with more frequent days with poor air quality seeming to have lower rates of asthma in adults.

# BACKGROUND

Asthma is a chronic, or long-term condition that affects the airways of the lungs. Asthma causes inflammation of these passages, which in turn narrows the airways. This narrowing causes symptoms like shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. While many consider asthma to be a childhood disease, asthma is also common in adults, affecting nearly 23 million US adults (Asthma in Adults | AAFA.org, 2024). Asthma triggers are things that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms, and include pollen, exercise, viral infections, or cold air (Keet et al., 2017). Air pollution, both indoor and outdoor, has also been linked to asthma symptoms (What Is Asthma? | NHLBI, NIH, 2024). While air pollution and asthma have been determined to be linked (Keet et al., 2017), it is not entirely clear if air pollution necessarily causes asthma, or if it simply causes or exacerbates symptoms in individuals already affected with asthma.


The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses the US Air Quality Index (AQI) to measure and report outdoor air quality. The AQI includes six categories, each based on a range of index values. The higher the AQI value, the greater the air pollution, and the worse the air quality. The below table illustrates the categories, as well as their effects on individuals (AQI Basics | AirNow.gov, n.d.).

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions  

Is there a correlation between the proportion of days with poor air quality and the percent of adults with current asthma?

## Hypothesis 

If poor air quality and asthma prevalence are linked, then states with more days with poor air quality will have more adults with asthma.

## Prediction

States with more days with recorded poor air quality will have higher prevalence of adults with asthma.

# METHODS

The data on asthma prevalence in adults was sourced from the CDC (Most Recent Asthma Data, 2024). For simplicity, we analyzed only the main 50 states, omitting the data on the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The data on air quality by state was sourced from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (Download Files | AirData | US EPA, n.d.). For both, the data was collected in 2022. The annual summary data was divided by county within each state, so to identify the average percentage of days with poor air quality, we took the average of all counties recorded in the state. We defined days with "poor" air quality as days with an AQI measuring moderate to hazardous. As each state had varying numbers of days recorded, we used the averages instead of counts.

After establishing that the data for both variables was normally distributed, a linear regression model was chosen to analyze the trend of the data, identifying whether there was a positive or negative correlation between the variables. A Pearson correlation test was performed following the results from the linear regression model in order to identify the strength of the correlation found. 

## First Analysis- Scatterplot

#### Confirmation of Normal Distribution

Prior to running statistical analyses, we had to confirm that the data is normally distributed. In order to do this, we created histograms to visualize the distribution of the data.

```{r}
#importing data
my_data <- read.csv("Updated Final Data.csv")

#create histogram
hist(my_data$Percentage.of..poor.air.quality..days, probability = TRUE,
     main = 'Distribution of poor air quality days',
     xlab = 'Percentage of poor air quality days')

#add mean vertical line
abline(v = mean(my_data$Percentage.of..poor.air.quality..days), col='red', lwd = 3)

#add curved line 
lines(density(my_data$Percentage.of..poor.air.quality..days), col='red', lwd = 3)

#create second histogram
hist(my_data$Percent.Adults.with.Current.Asthma, probability = TRUE,
     main = 'Distribution of percent adults with current asthma',
     xlab = 'Percentage of adults with current asthma')

#add mean vertical line
abline(v = mean(my_data$Percent.Adults.with.Current.Asthma), col='blue', lwd = 3)

#add curved distribution line
lines(density(my_data$Percent.Adults.with.Current.Asthma), col='blue', lwd = 3)

```

Since the histograms weren't obviously normal using visual analysis, we ran a Shapiro-Wilk test to confirm that they were not statistically different from normal. A Shapiro-Wilk test utilizes a null hypothesis that the data is sampled from a normally distributed population and an alternative hypothesis that it is not. A p-value of 0.05 or greater is interpreted as a failure to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is not statistical evidence that the data is not normally distributed. 

#### Shapiro-Wilk test on the percentage of poor air quality days:

```{r}
shapiro.test(my_data$Percentage.of..poor.air.quality..days)

```
Since the p-value of 0.5452 is greater than 0.05, there is insufficient evidence to state that the data is not normally distributed.

#### Shapiro-Wilk test for the percentage of adults with current asthma:

```{r}
shapiro.test(my_data$Percent.Adults.with.Current.Asthma)
```
Since the p-value of 0.4249 is greater than 0.05, there is insufficient evidence to state that the data is not normally distributed.

As tests on both variables have a p-value greater than 0.05, both can be assumed to be normally distributed, and therefore we can proceed to run additional statistical tests, such as a linear regression model and Pearson correlation test to evaluate the relationship between the two variables.

#### Scatterplot with Linear Regression

This visualization plots the proportion of days with poor air quality on the x-axis, and the percentage of adults with current asthma on the y-axis. Each data point corresponds to a state in the US. The slope of the red line is the result of a linear regression model performed on the data.

```{r}
#importing data
my_data <- read.csv("Updated Final Data.csv")


#running a linear regression model on the data
regression_model <- lm(my_data$Percent.Adults.with.Current.Asthma ~ my_data$Percentage.of..poor.air.quality..days)


#creating scatterplot 
plot(my_data$Percentage.of..poor.air.quality..days, my_data$Percent.Adults.with.Current.Asthma,
     main = "Poor Air Quality Days vs Percent Adults with Current Asthma",
     xlab = "Percentage of days with \"poor\" air quality",
     ylab = "Percentage of adults with current asthma",
     pch = 16,
     col = "blue4")

#adding regression line to the plot
abline(regression_model, col="red") 

#adding a legend with the slope, p-value, and multiple r-squared values from the regession line
legend("topright",
       legend= c("Slope= -4.5919","p-value= 0.0497", "Multiple R-squared= 0.07785"),
       cex = 0.6,
       bty = "n")


```



## Second Analysis- Pearson Correlation Test

This test measures the correlation between the proportion of days with poor air quality and the percent of adults with current asthma in each state. The analysis calculates a Pearson Correlation value between -1 and 1. A high score indicates high similarity, while a score near 0 indicates no correlation (“Data Simplification,” 2016).

```{r}
#run correlation test
rce <- cor(my_data$Percentage.of..poor.air.quality..days, my_data$Percent.Adults.with.Current.Asthma)

rce #view test result
```



# DISCUSSION

## Interpretation of Scatterplot
The scatter plot demonstrates a slight negative trend, opposing the original prediction of a positive correlation between the two variables. The linear regression model run has a p-value of 0.0497, indicating that the correlation is statistically significant. While the slope of the linear regression line is -4.5919, the data is not visually strongly associated with the line, something to be discussed in the following section.

## Interpretation of Pearson Correlation Test
To determine the strength of the correlation between the percentage of days with poor air quality and the percent adults with current asthma, a Pearson correlation test was run. The test provided an r-value of -0.279, indicating that there is a weak negative correlation between the variables. This result implies that while there is a statistically significant correlation, the correlation itself is weak, and confirms the linear regression result of a negative relationship.

# CONCLUSION
Statistical analysis of the relationship between the percentage of days with poor air quality and the percent of adults with current asthma by US state resulted in a weak, slightly negative correlation. This finding opposes the original prediction that there would be a positive correlation between the variables. Possible confounding factors and limitations of this study include the large sample locations, as air quality varies within areas of a state, as well as the wide definition of "poor" air quality. Limiting the definition to AQIs of more severity, such as excluding moderate and unhealthy for sensitive groups and restricting it to just unhealthy to hazardous AQIs may result in a more significant correlation, potentially changing the trend as well.
